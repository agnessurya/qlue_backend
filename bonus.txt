Parallel Programming?

In very simple terms, it is the use of multiple resources, in this case, processors, to solve a problem. 
This type of programming takes a problem, breaks it down into a series of smaller steps, delivers instructions, and processors execute the solutions at the same time.
It is also a form of programming that offers the same results as concurrent programming but in less time and with more efficiency

Concurrent programing? 
Simply described, itâ€™s when you are doing more than one thing at the same time.
 Not to be confused with parallelism, concurrency is when multiple sequences of operations are run in overlapping periods of time.
